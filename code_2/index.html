    This thesis explores how we as individuals but also as a society have over the last centuries slowly but 
    gradually become disconnected from real nourishment due to how food has been communicated to us. Hence I 
    want to research the involvement of graphic design in our habits, food and political systems since I 
    believe they are intricately intertwined. I would like to retrace the histories of food alongside the 
    development of design, which has always been a part of human societies, albeit under various forms. 
    From illustrating our ways of life to helping organise communities and introducing trade, design has 
    also been a crucial pillar for the development of food. Once solely used as a means of survival, now 
    it has grown into a dominant economic industry and part of capitalism. A model in which profit and 
    self-interest are central, even if that comes at the expense of health, ethics, the environment, and 
    equality. 
    <br> <br>
    This topic is quite significant to me because of my own personal experiences with health issues that 
    subsequently were linked to the food and medical system as we know it. A big reference point for 
    recognising that was eventually my own position as a graphic designer. This topic may not have been 
    used in my previous works, but it constitutes years of research by trying, failing, and trying again. 
    With this thesis, I hope to demonstrate links I have come to see between design and our food systems.

Hunters and Painters<br>
The Impact of food
</h3>

<p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -16px;">
    
    As far as can be traced back, we know that earth was inhabited by small tribes who scavenged most of their 
    food. A ‘hunter-gatherer’s diet mostly consisted of nuts, berries, roots, insects, edible herbs, mushrooms 
    and was filled with copious amounts of vitamins, minerals, and medicinal compounds, which resulted in a 
    nutrient abundance. It was typical to consume around 300 different types of foods in one week. However, 
    as the climate changed, harvesting certain plants became impossible and forced our ancestors to move habitats 
    and turn to new methods of eating. <span style="font-family: FreightTextBoldItalic;">1</span>  With the discovery of fire, meat and fish became more digestible, a 
    high-energy source of calories that did not require such a large intestinal system anymore. 
    Leslie C. Aiello, paleoanthropologist and professor, explains that around 1.5 million years ago early 
    humans began to eat more meat, and the biological feedback system that followed was that our brains grew 
    bigger, while our stomachs grew smaller. There is also research pointing to the fact that earlier species 
    had strong jaws and molar-like teeth, whereas later ones grew to have weaker jaws, smaller faces and 
    smaller teeth <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">[fig.1]</span>. The major factor for that development turns out to have been the change in eating 
    patterns. So thanks to the high-quality diet our ancestors consumed, food first might have been a means 
    of survival, followed by the discovery of better nourishment, which eventually led to evolution. In that 
    sense, diet plays a very important role in how we try to understand the course of human development, 
    both historically and in our current times. 

<p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -16px; text-align: center;">
<br>
    Food has and continues to play an integral 
    part in what our bodies become. 
<br> 
<br>
<p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -16px;"> 
    But so, how do we know what the human species did eat? On one part, Isotopic ecology, discovered that hyenas 
    and early humans were infected by the same type of tapeworms, directly implying that humans did consume meat 
    and fish. However, another proof of that is the discovery of cave paintings, which depicted humans’ earliest 
    forms of communication <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">[fig.2]</span>. These can be traced back as the first roots of graphic design, a visual 
    communication of certain ideas. The earliest known images are often abstract, consisting of circles, lines, 
    and waves, and may have been symbolic, whereas later ones illustrate animals, people, fire, spears, and tools, 
    as well as the act of hunting and preparing fires. The figural imagery may have recorded a narrative, while 
    the abstract symbols could have indicated records of a more symbolic nature. Some argue that cave art was 
    important for its existence and content, while others assert that its primary significance was in the ritual 
    act of painting and engraving it. Hunting was critical to humans’ survival and animal art in caves has often 
    been interpreted as an attempt to influence the success of the hunt, exert power over animals that were 
    simultaneously dangerous to early humans and vital to their existence, or to increase the fertility of herds 
    in the wild. Either way, they were painting their ways of life and using images purposefully to create a 
    narrative for themselves or others, while engaging in symbolism. Humans’ diet was not the only thing that 
    changed, they also slowly started documenting what was sacred, what was to be feared, or what simply just 
    was. The paintings act as a kind of record of the mythologies and histories of tribes, their rituals, their 
    beliefs and their nutrition before writing could serve that purpose.

The Birth of Language, Trade, <br>
Branding and Agriculture
</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
While humans evolved from nomadic communities and cave paintings to sedentary, or semi-sedentary communities 
and new communication systems, they did so partly through their transition from hunters and gatherers to 
food-exchanging communities. After they asked themselves, what foods were edible, which ones made them feel
better and which ones they could trade based on what each person had, the idea of farming and trade was born. 
However, as Yuval Noah Harari argues in ‘Sapiens,’ once a community grows larger than 150 people, a symbolic 
representation is required to establish a social order. 
<p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -1px;">
Thousands of years after cave paintings expressed concepts concerning daily life and thousands of years before 
the first alphabet was invented, a certain kind of written language developed. Consisting of a set of different 
signs followed one by another, they appear to be a language since they seem to convey a specific message. 
This early kind of writing was pictographs. The language was called cuneiform, originating in Sumer, Mesopotamia, 
c. 3500 -3000 BCE, and consisted of drawing specific marks in wet clay. With the rise of Mesopotamian cities and 
the need for resources that were lacking in the region, long-distance trade developed, as did the need to 
communicate across vast distances between cities or regions. Symbols that represented objects and food were 
developed to help order and remember which parcels of grain had gone to which destination or how many oxen were 
needed. Even clay tablets with records of the sale of beer were found <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">[fig.1]</span> 
. For this to be a coherent and 
understandable writing system, scribes had to master techniques of making these signs and inscribing them onto 
small tablets of clay. The art of arranging a message in a readable and pleasing composition is an early 
definition of typography. In Caps Lock, Ruben Pater explains the position of the scribe as a designer, being a 
typographer, a layout specialist, and a printer combined. He would be responsible for creating financial records 
and trustworthy documents, which would allow for a society to manage their agriculture and trade.
History is impossible to understand because there is no context in which to interpret physical evidence from the 
ancient past. Writing is the first necessary step in the written history of a culture or civilisation because it 
records the lives of people. The scribe, often being one of the very few to receive an education, had the 
responsibility to keep track of these records in an organised manner. Without the scribe, these large communities 
might not have been able to become agricultural economies. 
<p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -1px;">
At some point, farming became more complex, <span style="font-family: FreightTextBoldItalic;">1</span> and more 
organised <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">[fig.2]</span>  since it had to feed larger populations. 
People started assuming various professions  <span style="font-family: FreightTextLightItalic;">
    (architects, mathematicians, rulers, soldiers, and priests)</span>. Not 
everyone was a farmer or gardener anymore. That meant however, an entire population was at times dependent on one 
single type of crop, which did leave a high risk for natural disasters, such as floods or pests that could wipe 
out the harvest of an entire village or city. With the domestication of animals and plants, agriculture in full 
development, the monetisation of certain professions and food was well underway. It became clear that food was 
central and had an undeniable value. If you were able to have food on the table you were considered to be well 
off. The idea of ownership and what it meant socially, was not a new concept, even the genus Homo was familiar.
Maybe it is too early to imply, but one might think that these types of exchanges were where capitalism might 
have taken its roots.
<p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -1px;">
With trade flourishing, a way to stand out was the marking of an item for identification, consequently suggesting 
either familiarity or something to be of higher quality. A symbol or any other feature that distinguishes one 
seller’s good or service from those of other sellers is the very definition of branding, which seems to have taken 
origin already back in ancient civilisations. Places like ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome still mostly had 
illiterate populations, so the best way for merchants to sell their offerings was to hang pictorial signs and 
paint their storefronts. They would also burn marks into the wooden cases that were carrying their products, or 
sometimes were even pressed onto the products themselves. The ancient city of Pompeii has markings on its walls 
that show writing being used for advertising purposes. <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">[fig.3]</span>
 Looking back, branding was still closely connected 
to the maker of the product and a natural outcome of the production process, while compared to today, the maker 
couldn’t be further removed from it.

        The type of agriculture during that period of time is now referred to as ‘Horticulture’, 
        many anthropologists refer to it as ‘primitive agriculture’ as opposed to ‘farming’ since 
        it is carried on like simple gardening, supplementary to hunting and gathering. It didn’t 
        necessarily follow a certain structure; vegetables were grown under apple trees and harvesting 
        was mostly done by hand. </p><br>

            Development of <br>
            Nourishment and Botany
            
    </h3>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Once we were the ones foraging, hunting, and preparing our own food. We were completely aware of our 
        surroundings, which foods made us feel good, and which didn’t. We listened to our bodies every day. 
        Along with the domestication of plants and the categorisation of communities, various people assumed 
        roles related to the growing, harvesting, and selling of different foods and products. However, they 
        soon realised that food has a value, which can be used to their advantage since people will always 
        need to eat. Abuse of that power intensified hierarchical structures and dictated what one could afford, 
        as opposed to what one’s body actually needed. Eating whatever was available to one’s position took 
        away control over our own nourishment. 
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -1px;">
        Since the emergence of organisms and the genus Homo, plants and herbs were inherently part of our 
        environment. We might not exactly know how we as humans came to be, but when we did, we were surrounded 
        by greenery. I like to think that whatever was created had a purpose to be there and so did the plants 
        and animals that humans evolved with. Now whether we were supposed to live in harmony with the animals 
        of our time or whether one was supposed to live off one another, we will never know. But what we do know, 
        is that for millions of years that is how humans survived and evolved and I like to believe that accounts 
        for something.  
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -1px;">
        The prehistoric discovery that certain plants cause harm and others have curative powers predates written 
        history and is related to ancient wisdom, custom, and folklore. It is also the origin of the healing 
        professions and its practitioners <span style="font-family: FreightTextBoldItalic;">1</span> . 
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -16px;">
        The use of herbs as medicine may even be part of animal instinct. 
        Sick animals tend to forage plants rich in secondary metabolites such as tannins and alkaloids. Because 
        these phytochemicals often have antiviral, antibacterial, anti-fungal, and anthelminthic properties, 
        animals may be self-medicating. 
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -16px;">
        Botany and medicine were essentially in step until the 18th century, 
        until one art turned scientific, and from this juncture on, botanical works would essentially be ignored 
        for medicinal uses. The medicinal use of plants is seen as an alternate form of medicine and often
        questioned for its efficacy and is quickly associated with superstition, even if most drugs of today’s 
        times were originally plant-derived. 
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -1px;">
        <br>
        Plant cures and nutrition were embedded into ancient medicine based on philosophical concepts from 
        ancient civilisations such as Sumer, Babylonia, Greece, China, and India. Each of these medical systems 
        formed a close relationship with nutrition and medicinal plants. The consumption of vegetables, fruits, 
        and herbs revealed to promote health and well-being was shown to depend on nutrition. Even a Sumerian 
        tablet dating from 2100 BCE was found to contain a dozen prescriptions for plants from the ancient Nile 
        Valley <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">[fig.1]</span>. 
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -16px;">
        As for Greek medicine, knowledge of plants that cured was practiced by root diggers 
        <span style="font-family: FreightTextLightItalic;">(rhizotomoi)</span>, followed by the words remedy/drug 
        and let to drug merchants <span style="font-family: FreightTextLightItalic;">(pharacopuloi)</span>,
         giving rise 
        to the word pharmacy. According to Hippocrates, the so-called father of modern medicine, there were a 
        set of causes that influence health:
        <br> <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">1)</span> 
        food and drink, <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">2)</span> ambient air,
        <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">3)</span> movement and rest, 
        <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">4)</span> sleep and wakefulness, 
        <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">5)</span> elimination and retention and 
         <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">6)</span> psychological states. 
        These concepts, adopted, 
        elaborated on, and further developed by Byzantine and Arab physicians, dominated medicine until the 
        18th century. 
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -16px;">
        The amount of ancient medical scholars was however greater in the East than in the West. 
        In the East, there are two dominant traditions, Chinese medicine and Indian medicine, known as Ayurveda,
        ‘the science of life’. Associated with the beginning of the healing arts in traditional Chinese medicine 
        is a fundamental text, ‘The Huangdi neijing’ <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">[fig.2]</span>, 
        or the Yellow Emperor’s Inner Classic, containing 
        documents, written on silk and bamboo slips, describing 52 diseases, 283 prescriptions, and 247 drugs 
        including liquorice, scute, atractylodes, achyranthes, and conidium. Both, Ancient Greek medicine and 
        Ayurvedic medicine might have influenced one another since they both contain striking similarities. 
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -1px;">
        <br>
        As for the documentation of this knowledge, scribes were again needed, taking the position of the 
        typesetter, record keeper, illustrator, designer, and printer.

            From Farmers to Revolutions <br>
            to Fictional Characters
            
    </h3>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Around the mid-1600s, two-thirds of the working population in Great Britain consisted of farmers, 
        relative to other European countries. At that point, the British parliament started offering up 
        those lands previously owned by the small-scale farmers to wealthy landowners. What resulted was 
        a mass migration of all these people who had just lost their land and their only means of income 
        - to the cities, thereby reducing the food-producing workforce in the rural ends, but doubling 
        new kinds of work-seeking groups in the cities. Around the same time, technological innovation 
        in the mechanisation of the processing and manufacturing of food paved the way for the industrial 
        revolution. While new developments also had to be made in the agricultural sector, botanists 
        started experimenting with chemically produced fertilisers in order to improve food crop productions 
        <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">[fig.1]</span>.
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -16px; text-align: center;">
        <br>
        Food started taking its steps towards an optimised, <br>profit-bearing system/experiment.
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -1px;">
        With the industrial revolution set in motion <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">[fig.2]</span>, production was multiplied tenfold and flooded 
        the market with identical products. Quantity may have increased, but quality certainly did not. It 
        was said that the invention of machines was there to facilitate human labor, but working in the 
        factories might have been even more exhausting and dehumanising than farming ever was. While land- 
        and factory owners grew even richer, the working conditions of the middle class worsened tremendously. 
        They were subjected to gruelling shifts, monotonous but backbreaking tasks, and exposed to chemical 
        fumes which ended up leading to irreversible health hazards.
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -1px;">
        In an age, with countless alternatives constantly saturating the shelves, when excitement followed 
        innovation one after the other, a ‘simple’ product such as oats had to be made more distinguishable 
        and interesting <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">[fig.3]</span>. 
        Previously a way to distinguish oneself, the maker would sign wooden boxes, 
        or even the product itself - with his own name. However even that started to blur in the midst of all 
        too similar-looking signages and with the scale of it all, quite impossible to hand sign each and 
        every product. 
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -1px;">
        Soon artists were hired for what would later become the graphic designer’s job as a brander. Ruben Pater 
        explains in Caps Lock that to stand out, artists were asked to invent narratives, names, and symbols. 
        Anything to create pleasant associations between the brand and the consumer. To instill a familiar 
        feeling onto lifeless industry products, fictional characters were invented (such as Quaker, Chiquita, 
        Tony the Tiger for Frosted Flakes) <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">[fig.4]</span>. 
        The idea was that by encapsulating certain emotions or 
        connotations, (also concealed as the brands’ values) into those illustrations, a brand would create 
        a sense of emotional belonging or familiarity. The branding that followed even thought of specific 
        ways of speaking, informal language, and friendly imagery, in order to build a human personality that 
        would appeal to a consumer’s subconscious.  <span style="font-family: FreightTextBoldItalic;">1</span>

                The easiest and most innocent subconscious to appeal to is that of a child’s, 
                which is why a lot of the branding is directly aimed at them. Brands pay a 
                premium to have their product placed on a shelf that is at a kid’s eye level. 
                When they join their parent to the supermarket, an appealing and friendly character 
                smiles right at them. The brand gambles on the hope that the parent will just buy 
                the product to avoid a tantrum. It is a known strategy in marketing termed as 
                ‘nag factor’ or ‘pester power’. Kids are seen as a major market force because 
                of having that purchase influence while on top being groomed towards lifelong 
                brand loyalty. </p><br>

            Contemporary Changing <br>
            Perspectives regarding Food<br>
            and its Representations
            
    </h3>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Throughout history, we have come to see that food and graphic design play a central role in our world. 
        Food is not only a biological need, one that has sustained life for many thousands of years, but it also 
        impacts human culture and society. Food and design have shaped societal structure, driven economic 
        development and trade while becoming intricately tied to cultural identity through traditions, beliefs,
        and ethics. However, all these factors also come to impact human health. 
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -1px; text-align: center;">
        In a time where disease suddenly is not just on the rise, but peaking, one <br> might wonder if today’s 
        food could have anything to do with it? <span style="font-family: FreightTextBoldItalic;">1</span> 
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -1px;">
        The aftermath of World War II marks a moment in time when the food production system underwent radical 
        transformations. Although changes in how food was farmed, packaged, and sold already occurred during 
        the Industrial revolution, it was mostly in how things could be optimised through machinery, horsepower 
        on the fields, crop rotations, factories, and distribution systems, - food itself though had not really 
        been interfered with. However, in times of food disparity and a malnourished and trauma-inflicted 
        population, governmental agencies across the US and Europe hired scientists to quickly develop new 
        high-yield varieties of crops and breeds of livestock, alongside synthetic fertilisers, pesticides, 
        and herbicides, to boost food production. <span style="font-family: FreightTextBoldItalic;">2</span> 
        While the quantity rose dramatically, nutrient levels in 
        those very crops declined. Studies indicate that the nutrient content of certain fruits and vegetables 
        has been declining since 1950 at an alarming rate. According to a US study from 2004, some garden crops 
        have up to 38% less of key nutrients than they did in the middle of the 20th century. By using fertilisers 
        and herbicides to produce more and more food, soil has become depleted of nutrients, which has a knock-on 
        effect on the foods grown there. <span style="font-family: FreightTextBoldItalic;">3</span>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -16px;">
        Even more so after the 2008 commodity crisis, there was a big turning point in investment groups, as 
        they had made food their new target since it is a value that can never depreciate as long as a population 
        keeps growing (and eating). They realised there was money in agricultural commodities. They could just 
        take a primal material, add value by processing it, and sell it for a profit. This is most effective on 
        the condition that their sales pitch to the consumer is health and convenience at a ‘cheap’ price. Every 
        population up until this paradigm shift had only known their dishes as being prepared from scratch and
        cooked from the comfort of their home, so how else could you suddenly justify canned soups or ready-to-go
        meals?  <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">[fig.1]</span>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -1px;">
        Advertisement is central to the marketing of the food supply. Vigorous competitors and food being a 
        repeat-purchase item is the reason this has become such a huge industry. 4 Back in the 1960s the 
        designer’s job was mostly to work in print/packaging. Today we have social media, influencers, TV, 
        YouTube, internet websites, posters, billboards, print, and radio, - it seems advertising (which comes 
        hand in hand with graphic design) has infiltrated every corner of our lives. Most of us argue that we 
        do not feel influenced by all this, but if estimations are that the average person views more than 10,000 
        advertisements annually, does it really not affect our thinking at all? Even subconsciously? 
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -16px;">
        The real problem though is that the most heavily marketed products such as sodas, sweets, crisps, 
        cereals and well unfortunately also vegan meat substitutes, are foods that are void of any nutrition.
        Instead, they are filled with lists of unpronounceable ingredients, high amounts of sugar, inflammatory
        fats, refined salts, artificial flavourings, and texture-improving ingredients, which will trigger a 
        spike of dopamine and in turn leave us craving for more  <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">
        [fig.2]</span>. This is no accident. Big Food  <span style="font-family: FreightTextBoldItalic;">4</span>  
        has spent billions on bioengineering flavour enhancers, on lobbying policymakers, and on greenwashing 
        their products as healthy and nutritious, when actually these are exactly the kind of products that 
        are behind an epidemic of modern diseases. 
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -1px;">
        And yet for some reason, we put so much blind trust into science, medicine, and supermarkets, without 
        really doing our own diligence. This is not to say that we should question professionals in their fields,
        I mean who is to say we are better experts than someone with years of academic accomplishments? 
        Nevertheless, we should be experts when it comes to the needs of our own bodies. Maybe we should doubt 
        the decisions made by the people who will profit most from them. Does a profit-driven corporate 
        conglomerate really have our health on top of their list of priorities? 
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -1px;">
        In the past couple of years, vegan meat substitutes have become quite popular and caused several debates 
        about our planet, our ethics, and our health. While we’ve been busy debating whether we should eat meat 
        or chickpeas, large agro-businesses and biotech companies have taken advantage of the opportunity and 
        entered the lucrative “green” consumer market. They are specifically targeting young, environment-conscious 
        consumers who are critical of the industrial food production. They will advertise themselves as 
        ‘eco-friendly’, ‘healthy’, and ‘sustainable’, when none of those things apply to them in reality. Something 
        we seem to forget is that brands can legally market themselves as anything they want. They can even use 
        phrasings such as ‘rich in protein’ or ‘low in sugars’, or ‘we care about the environment’, and count 
        those as ‘design elements’ instead of actual pieces of information. In that case, it seems graphic design 
        partakes in the spread of misinformation through the use of creative design strategies to help disguise 
        key information. 
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -16px;">
        These companies fail to deal with the underlying issues of industrial agriculture and its effects on the 
        planet since it is the same circle of business people who invest and benefit from the growth of the 
        biotech sector.
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -16px;">
        When we talk about vegan food companies we aren’t talking about NGOs, we are talking about large 
        agricultural corporations. A plant-based burger will generally have at least 10 to 20 different 
        ingredients <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">[fig.3]</span>
        , which go through a lengthy process of being put together under chemically 
        assisted, lab-grown conditions . But more importantly, they are called plant-based but you will 
        not find any real plants in these products. They work to further entrench industrial agriculture 
        models to keep relying on globalised commodity chains, agrochemicals 
        <span style="font-family: FreightTextMediumItalic;">[fig.4]</span>, GMO monocultures, 
        and conventional animal production. Synthetic foods are now being used as a tool to further 
        concentrate the wealth and power of a small number of gaping giants without having to deal with 
        the negative effects on the environment, human health, and accelerated climate change. Making 
        ultra-processed food like this requires a huge amount of energy and consumes a lot of plastic. 
        It is very far from being a 0 waste, environment-conscious industry. Instead, they just use a 
        speech of sustainability and awareness, when in fact they are investment groups, who clearly 
        are here to make money. These artificial foods seem to only strengthen corporate control over 
        food and health, speed up the downfall of regional food economies, and further undermine food 
        democracy. 
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -1px;">
        Looking back at our histories with food and design, we can say with certainty that a myriad of 
        things have changed. We’ve been steering forward for so long but what if we looked back and learned 
        from our past? We think we need to come up with new solutions, but what 
        if all the answers we need have already always been here? Instead of working against nature, maybe 
        we should do our best to mimic her or at least work with her? 
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -1px;">
        To address the environmental and health crises, we should look at processes that rejuvenate the 
        planet, such as aero-ecological or regenerative farming. We should aim to avoid or even just 
        minimise consuming ultra-processed foods. Try to shop local and organic to support small farmers 
        and food producers. To choose humbly raised grass-fed meat and dairy, or organic alternatives if 
        set on a vegan/vegetarian diet. And mostly, we should be curious, be investigative about where our food 
        really comes from and what impact it has on the planet and its makers but most importantly on ourselves. 
        How can we fight for food quality when we ourselves are not healing? <br> <br> <br> <br>

            My experience</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -1px;">
        I have had my fair share when it comes to health issues, which eventually were mostly related to food. 
        I thought I was asking the right questions, but really I just believed what the slogans said.  
        Years spent in sickness and hospitals, I never really cared about my food. I also became a vegan and 
        vegetarian. I cared about animals, about the environment, the planet, world hunger, even later on I 
        did it for the health aspect of it. However, I had not any idea where my food actually came from. I 
        just believed when a food labeled that they were ‘environmnet friendly’ or ‘healthy’, that they were 
        honest. When I was vegan and my health took a hit, I didn’t consider that food could have anything to 
        do with it. I had gotten to a point I couldn’t stand up or walk, I had to sleep for at least 10 hours 
        a night and still could barely keep my eyes open during the day. I felt extremely anxious, struggled 
        with brain fog, memory issues, suddenly ADHD symptoms, even depression creeped her way in. My period 
        became a nightmare and well my life had gotten affected in every single way.
        <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: -16px;">
        It is only when I started 
        dismantling the layers of misinformation around our food and medical systems, that healing started to 
        take place. I started cooking from scratch, bought as much organic, in season - produce as possible, 
        and slowly re-introduced quality proteins such as meat, eggs, fish and butter. My diet became so much 
        simpler and closer to what our ancestors diet was, and in retrospect I can’t say that I am surprised. 
        For a long time I hated that I had this terrible experinence with health and food, I hated that it had 
        taken me so long to get better and mostly I hated that noboy ever told me the importance of what we eat 
        is and how much it affects us. Now I aspire to use my experience as a way to help shed some light or 
        awareness to the people around me. Slowly I start to appreciate my experience because it has thought 
        me more, than any book, podcast or article ever will. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

        In 2017, the Global Burden of Disease study found that heart disease, diabetes, 
        and cancer are the most common causes of preventable death today, with poor diet 
        making up the highest risk factor. </p><br>

        Between 1961 and 2014, the average global cereal yield increased by 175%; 
        for instance, wheat’s average yield increased from 1.1 to 3.4 tonnes per 
        hectare during that same timeframe. </p><br>

        To give an idea of how abundant soil can be: ‘A teaspoon of soil contains 
        more microbes than there are people on the planet, and perhaps as many as 
        10’ooo individual species.’ </p><br>
